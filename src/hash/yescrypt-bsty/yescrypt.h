 * with crypto_scrypt().  param and paramlen specify a local parameter with
 * which the ROM is seeded.  If buf is not NULL, then it is used to return
 * buflen bytes of message digest for the initialized ROM (the caller may use
 * this to verify that the ROM has been computed in the same way that it was on
 * a previous run).
 *
 * Return 0 on success; or -1 on error.
 *
 * If bit YESCRYPT_SHARED_PREALLOCATED in flags is set, then memory for the
 * ROM is assumed to have been preallocated by the caller, with
 * shared->shared1.aligned being the start address of the ROM and
 * shared->shared1.aligned_size being its size (which must be consistent with
 * N, r, and p).  This may be used e.g. when the ROM is to be placed in a SysV
 * shared memory segment allocated by the caller.
 *
 * mask controls the frequency of ROM accesses by yescrypt_kdf().  Normally it
 * should be set to 1, to interleave RAM and ROM accesses, which works well
 * when both regions reside in the machine's RAM anyway.  Other values may be
 * used e.g. when the ROM is memory-mapped from a disk file.  Recommended mask
 * values are powers of 2 minus 1 or minus 2.  Here's the effect of some mask
 * values:
 * mask	value	ROM accesses in SMix 1st loop	ROM accesses in SMix 2nd loop
 *	0		0				1/2

/**
 * yescrypt_kdf(shared, local, passwd, passwdlen, salt, saltlen,

 * p, buflen), or a revision of scrypt as requested by flags and shared, and
 * write the result into buf.  The parameters N, r, p, and buflen must satisfy
 * the same conditions as with crypto_scrypt().  t controls computation time
 * while not affecting peak memory usage.  shared and flags may request
 * special modes as described below.  local is the thread-local data
 * structure, allowing to preserve and reuse a memory allocation across calls,
 * thereby reducing its overhead.
 *
 * Return 0 on success; or -1 on error.
 *
 * t controls computation time.  t = 0 is optimal in terms of achieving the
 * highest area-time for ASIC attackers.  Thus, higher computation time, if
 * affordable, is best achieved by increasing N rather than by increasing t.
 * However, if the higher memory usage (which goes along with higher N) is not
 * affordable, or if fine-tuning of the time is needed (recall that N must be a
 * power of 2), then t = 1 or above may be used to increase time while staying
 * at the same peak memory usage.  t = 1 increases the time by 25% and
 * decreases the normalized area-time to 96% of optimal.  (Of course, in
 * absolute terms the area-time increases with higher t.  It's just that it
 * would increase slightly more with higher N*r rather than with higher t.)
 * t = 2 increases the time by another 20% and decreases the normalized
 * area-time to 89% of optimal.  Thus, these two values are reasonable to use
 * for fine-tuning.  Values of t higher than 2 result in further increase in
 * time while reducing the efficiency much further (e.g., down to around 50% of
 * optimal for t = 5, which runs 3 to 4 times slower than t = 0, with exact
 * numbers varying by the flags settings).
 *
 * Classic scrypt is available by setting t = 0 and flags to YESCRYPT_WORM and
 * passing a dummy shared structure (see the description of
 * yescrypt_init_shared() above for how to produce one).  In this mode, the
 * thread-local memory region (RAM) is first sequentially written to and then
 * randomly read from.  This algorithm is friendly towards time-memory
 * tradeoffs (TMTO), available both to defenders (albeit not in this
 * implementation) and to attackers.
 *
 * Setting YESCRYPT_RW adds extra random reads and writes to the thread-local
 * memory region (RAM), which makes TMTO a lot less efficient.  This may be
 * used to slow down the kinds of attackers who would otherwise benefit from
 * classic scrypt's efficient TMTO.  Since classic scrypt's TMTO allows not
 * only for the tradeoff, but also for a decrease of attacker's area-time (by
 * up to a constant factor), setting YESCRYPT_RW substantially increases the
 * cost of attacks in area-time terms as well.  Yet another benefit of it is
 * that optimal area-time is reached at an earlier time than with classic
 * scrypt, and t = 0 actually corresponds to this earlier completion time,
 * resulting in quicker hash computations (and thus in higher request rate
 * capacity).  Due to these properties, YESCRYPT_RW should almost always be
 * set, except when compatibility with classic scrypt or TMTO-friendliness are
 * desired.
 *
 * YESCRYPT_PARALLEL_SMIX moves parallelism that is present with p > 1 to a
 * lower level as compared to where it is in classic scrypt.  This reduces
 * flexibility for efficient computation (for both attackers and defenders) by
 * requiring that, short of resorting to TMTO, the full amount of memory be
 * allocated as needed for the specified p, regardless of whether that
 * parallelism is actually being fully made use of or not.  (For comparison, a
 * single instance of classic scrypt may be computed in less memory without any
 * CPU time overhead, but in more real time, by not making full use of the
 * parallelism.)  This may be desirable when the defender has enough memory
 * with sufficiently low latency and high bandwidth for efficient full parallel
 * execution, yet the required memory size is high enough that some likely
 * attackers might end up being forced to choose between using higher latency
 * memory than they could use otherwise (waiting for data longer) or using TMTO
 * (waiting for data more times per one hash computation).  The area-time cost
 * for other kinds of attackers (who would use the same memory type and TMTO
 * factor or no TMTO either way) remains roughly the same, given the same
 * running time for the defender.  In the TMTO-friendly YESCRYPT_WORM mode, as
 * long as the defender has enough memory that is just as fast as the smaller
 * per-thread regions would be, doesn't expect to ever need greater
 * flexibility (except possibly via TMTO), and doesn't need backwards
 * compatibility with classic scrypt, there are no other serious drawbacks to
 * this setting.  In the YESCRYPT_RW mode, which is meant to discourage TMTO,
 * this new approach to parallelization makes TMTO less inefficient.  (This is
 * an unfortunate side-effect of avoiding some random writes, as we have to in
 * order to allow for parallel threads to access a common memory region without
 * synchronization overhead.)  Thus, in this mode this setting poses an extra
 * tradeoff of its own (higher area-time cost for a subset of attackers vs.
 * better TMTO resistance).  Setting YESCRYPT_PARALLEL_SMIX also changes the
 * way the running time is to be controlled from N*r*p (for classic scrypt) to
 * N*r (in this modification).  All of this applies only when p > 1.  For
 * p = 1, this setting is a no-op.
 *
 * Passing a real shared structure, with ROM contents previously computed by
 * yescrypt_init_shared(), enables the use of ROM and requires YESCRYPT_RW for
 * the thread-local RAM region.  In order to allow for initialization of the
 * ROM to be split into a separate program, the shared->shared1.aligned and
 * shared->shared1.aligned_size fields may be set by the caller of
 * yescrypt_kdf() manually rather than with yescrypt_init_shared().
 *
 * local must be initialized with yescrypt_init_local().
 *
 * MT-safe as long as local and buf are local to the thread.
